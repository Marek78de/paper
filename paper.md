# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but 
continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which 
measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale.

# Simulations

We simulate the evoulution of particle sizes as they are carried 
away from the source region.

# Methology 
Something that we do

# Results 
I had some results and I want to publish them on whatever
## Result no 1 
Nothing to say here now. 

# Figures
Figures go in the own section in the draft paper

## Added some more figures 

# Conclusions 
We have made fantastic insight into the bla, need more 
FUNDING!
